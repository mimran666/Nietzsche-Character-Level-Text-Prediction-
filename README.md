## ðŸ§ª Sample Output

The model takes a 40-character input string and predicts the next character using a trained character-level neural network. It then recursively generates characters until a space is reached, simulating natural phrase completions.

Each output represents a possible word ending based on the model's learned patterns from Nietzschean text. For example:
- `"ong "` â†’ likely completes to `"strong"`
- `"ength "` â†’ likely completes to `"strength"`
- `"uggle "` â†’ could be `"struggle"`

These predictions reflect the modelâ€™s understanding of philosophical language structure and its ability to generate coherent continuations.
